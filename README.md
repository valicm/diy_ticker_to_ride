# DIY tickets

There are many DIY maps for "[Ticket to Ride](https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/)", but there are none train and locomotive car cards.



Note: I am not designer, so design of the cards is far from top notch!



I recommend that you buy the original board game. This is not drop-in replacement, and I am not encouraging you to print these. You definetly would not save money, but opposite.
Those are only train cards, you still need route cards, map, board pieces, etc..



Specification:

- card color pages are 17x26cm

- card background is 19x28cm

- prepared for printing on A4 paper



How to print?

- inside folder "pages" you have each color separate as PDF, as well background for cards, if you want to combine each color for both-side print.

- print on A4 (recommend > 160g paper)
  
  
  
  *note that inside folder extra I added additional yellow and some borderless wildcard cards. You don't need those. I am going to add more borderless cards most likely, that was intention in the beginning, but it require more precising cutting*



What you need?

- a printer!

- paper - can be any weight, but to get proper felling of a card, use paper > 160g

- ruler, scalpel
